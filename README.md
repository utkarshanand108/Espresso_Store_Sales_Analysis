Course: DS PGC Course 2 — Assignment 1

## Project summary
This repository contains my solution for **Assignment 1** of DS PGC Course 2.  
The assignment uses an Excel workbook to perform 10 tasks on the Espresso Store sales dataset, including formatting, sorting & filtering, lookups, text functions, date calculations, What-If analysis, and Pivot Table reporting.

## How to open and review
1. Download `ExcelAssignment1.xlsx` to your local machine.  
2. Open with **Microsoft Excel (desktop)** — some features (Data Table, Goal Seek, Pivot Chart) show full functionality only in desktop Excel.  
3. Check the sheet tabs — there should be **10 sheets**, each solving the corresponding task. Sheet names used in my workbook:
   - `Task-1_Format`
   - `Task-2_FilterSort`
   - `Task-3_Lookup`
   - `Task-4_Labeling`
   - `Task-5_TextExtract`
   - `Task-6_Replacements`
   - `Task-7_DateCalc`
   - `Task-8_WhatIf`
   - `Task-9_PivotTable`
   - `Task-10_Summary`
4. On each sheet I have included:
   - A header with the **Task number** and a one-line description.
   - The **formula** used shown in a nearby cell or comment for easy grader review.
   - For Pivot Table sheet: both the pivot table and its pivot chart are present.

## How I solved it (short)
- Tools used: **Microsoft Excel** (desktop) — formulas, conditional formatting, Data Table, Goal Seek, Pivot Table & charts.  
- Approach: completed each task on a separate sheet to keep work organized and easy to review.  
- Key formulas and features are annotated on each sheet for the grader.
